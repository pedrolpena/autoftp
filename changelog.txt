05.05.2011 Changed default caret update policy for the status JTextArea to
always update.

05.11.2011 Added append method in Uploadit and SunFtpWrapper that accepts
a reference to the File object to be uploaded instead of passing a string
that is later used to create a File object.The reason is that AutoFTP later
creates a File object for the same file and this can cause conflicts.

05.05.2011 Append method now accepts a JTextArea Object that it updates with
file upload status.

05.05.2011 Changed UleadThread from a Runnable implementation to inherit
from Thread. This allows a reference to use the isAlive() method to make
sure the thread is dead before creating it to access rasdial.

08.02.2011 The program zips any file that does not contain the .zip extension
before transmitting.

08.02.2011 If there is a no such directory error while uploading it will
upload to the "/default" folder.

08.05.2011 Added statements to close any open streams in the catch blocks
of the append and upload methods of SunFtpWrapper.

08.08.2011 Now saves transmitted files names in an sqlite database and checks
the database before dialing. if the filename is found in the database then
the file is deleted and a connection is never attempted. This was added
because it was noticed that the program attempted to upload a file that had
already been uploaded continuously.

12.08.2011 Added login and server connect attempt tracking. If there are 5
consecutive failed login or server connect attempts then the program will
stop attempting to connect every time it checks the queue. instead it will
try and connect once every 24 hours until it successfully connects. Since
every successful connection has a cost, one can potentially receive a huge
bill without ever transmitting any data.

12.13.2011 Added a connection log to track connect times.

05.24.2011 Added initializations to app preferences because new installs
were crashing at startup.

08.09.2014 Replaced sun FTP library with apache commons FTP client library 3.3.

08.13.2014 Added messaging socket server to transmit messages.

08.14.2014 Added crc check o determine of zip file is good before sending.

07.17.2014 Added A CommandClient which is a socket thread that attempts
to connect to the messaging server. The program will close if a connection
is made.  This is to make sure there is only ever one instance of the program
up and running.

08.04.2014 Modified transmitted file database to include transmission
date. This is added using epoch time. milliseconds since Jan 1st 1970 00:00:00

08.07.2014 Modified wasTransmitted method to return false if an exception
occurs and to check if the result set is empty

08.07.2014 Added method to log exceptions.

08.08.2014 Changed when it is considered a successful connection for the
purposes of the 24 hour queue timer. the failed attempts timer is reset when
successfully set to binary mode.

08.08.2014 Replaced "\n" by system dependent newline character in the log
file methods.

10.14.2014 Started versioning with gitorious.

06.03.2014 Moved from gitorious to github.

06.04.2015 Fixed date issue where it was logging in a 12 hour format. it
now logs in 24 hour format.

06.04.2015 Changed "resuming download" message to "resuming upload" in
UploadIt.java.

06.04.2015 By popular demand, changed "Partial file is not on the server"
message to "First attempt".

06.04.2015 Can now disable messages to standard out by passing it false as
a command line argument.
